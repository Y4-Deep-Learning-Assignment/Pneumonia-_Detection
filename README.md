## 🚨 Pneumonia Detection 🚨

> **⚠️ Important:**  
> 🔴 Create **separate branches** yourself for development.  
> 🔴 Continue coding **independently** in your own branch.  
> 🔴 Build and experiment with **your own models** for Pneumonia Detection.  
> 🔴 Keep code modular and commit changes frequently.  
> 🔴 Use clear commit messages for easier tracking.

📂 **Goal:**  
Develop and evaluate **deep learning models** for detecting Pneumonia from **Chest X-Ray images**.  

**Dataset**
- Kaggle : Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset
